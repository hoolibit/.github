# Shaping the future of computing

- What if programming could be less about how computers work and more about computation itself?
- ...if everything that is parallelizable will be parallelized automatically to benefit from multicore processors?
- ...if computation that is more suitable for the GPU could be moved there effortlessly?
- ...if computation could seamlessly work over networks to extend to different machines?
- ...if doing anything that is unsafe in terms of memory access or concurrency was impossible?
- ...if correctness could be proved at compile-time?
- ...if programs could be like time machines in that the state at a given instant could be determined instantly?

This is what we're bringing to life. We're theorizing a brand new paradigm of computation and designing a programming language around it. We're excited for a wide range of products and services that this will make possible.

Stay tuned!
